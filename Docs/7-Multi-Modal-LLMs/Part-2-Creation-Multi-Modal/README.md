**Module 2 - Creating a Multimodal Model: Combining LLM with Images**
===========================================================

In the world of artificial intelligence, multimodal models that combine text and visual information have gained significant attention. These models can process both textual and image data, allowing for more comprehensive understanding and richer interactions. In this blog post, we'll explore how to create a multimodal model by integrating a large language model (LLM) with a large collection of images.

## Introduction

Multimodal models bridge the gap between language and vision, enabling applications such as image captioning, visual question answering, and more. By combining the power of LLMs with visual data, we can build systems that understand and generate content across different modalities.

In this tutorial, we'll cover the following steps:

1. **Choosing a Multi-Modal LLM**: We'll select an appropriate M that supports multimodal input (both text and images).
2. **Loading Image Data**e'll gather a large collection of images.
3. **Initializing the Multi-Modal LLM**: We'll set up the LLM to handle both text and image inputs.
4. **Building a Multi-Modal Vector Store/Index**: We'll create an index that combines LLM embeddings with image features.
5. **Retrieving Information**: We'll demonstrate how to retrieve relevant information from the multimodal mode
6. **Optional Query Engine**: If you want to query the model, we'll set up a simple query engine.

Let's dive into the details!

## 1. Choosing a Multi-Modal LLM

There are several options for multimodal LLMs. Here are w examples:

* **GPT-4V**: This variant of GPT-4 allows joint input of text and images, producing text as output.
* **Video-LLaMA**: Specifically designed for video understanding, it integrates image and audio information with LLM embeddings.
* **Ollama Multimodel Models**: Ollama now supports multimodal models, allowing them to answer prompts using visual information.

For this tutorial, we'll use GPT-4V.

## 2. Loading Image Data

Start by collecting a large dataset of images. You can load them from URLs or a local directory. Here's an example in Python:
```python
import os
from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader

# Load image documents from a local directory
image_directory = "./images"
image_documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(image_directory).load_data()
```
## 3. Initializing the Multi-Modal LLM

Instantiate the chosen multimodal LLM (GPT-4V) with relevant parameters:
```python
import os
from llama_index.multi_modal_llms.openai import OpenAIMultiModal

# Set your OpenAI API token
OPENAI_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_API_TOKEN"

# Initialize GPT-4V
openai_mm_llm = OpenAIMultiModal(model="gpt-4-vision-preview", api_key=OPENAI_API_TOKEN, max_new_tokens=300)
```
## 4. Building a Multi-Modal Vector Store/Index

Create a vector store/index that combines text and image information. We'll use Qdrant for this purpose:
```python
import qdrant
from llama_index.core.indices import MultiModalVectorStoreIndex
from llama_index.vector_stores.qdrant import QdrantVectorStore

# Create a Qdrant client
client = qdrant.Client(host="localhost", port=6333)

# Create Qdrant vector stores for text and image
text_collection_name = "text_collection"
image_collection_name = "image_collection"
text_store = QdrantVectorStore(client, collection_name=text_collection_name)
image_store = QdrantVectorStore(client, collection_name=image_collection_name)

# Load text and image documents
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(image_directory).load_data()

# Create the MultiModal index
index = MultiModalVectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents, storage_context={"text": text_store, "image": image_store})
```
## 5. Retrieving Information

Use the index as a retriever to get more information from the LLM response:
```python
retriever_engine = index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=3, image_similarity_top_k=3)
response = openai_mm_llm.complete(prompt="what is in the image?", image_documents=image_documents)
retrieval_results = retriever_engine.retrieve(response)
```
## 6. Optional Query Engine

If you want to query the multimodal model, set up a query engine:
```python
from llama_index.core import PromptTemplate

qa_tmpl_str = (
    "Context information is below.\n"
    "---------------------\n"
    "{context_str}\n"
    "---------------------\n"
    "Given the context information and not prior knowledge, "
    "answer the query.\n"
    "Query:  {query_str}\n"
    "Answer: "
)
qa_tmpl = PromptTemplate(qa_tmpl_str)

query_engine = index.as_query_engine(multi_modal_llm=openai_mm_llm, text_qa_template=qa_tmpl)
query_str = "Tell me more about the Porsche"
response = query_engine.query(query_str)
```
**Conclusion**

In this tutorial, we've demonstrated how to create a multimodal model by combining a large language model (LLM) with a large collection of images. We've covered the steps of choosing a multimodal LLM, loading image data, initializing the LLM, building a multimodal vector store/index, retrieving information, and setting up an optional query engine. By following these steps, you can create a powerful multimodal model that can process and understand both text and image data.
